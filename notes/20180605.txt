Kick Off 20180605

The goal is provide information re whereabouts of the employee at any given time point.

Use cases:
- need to put the information where it can be easily retrieved by other participants
- No enterprise permissions
- Search by person
- Search by date
- Hard coded locations first + comments about vacation
- Same for set of users predefined
- Proper auth for future, but session would be user aware for now
- User should be able to announce his location for future 
- Possibly overlap for several users on the same view
- Same backed for both implementations (react vs view)


Design questions:
Show me where is everyone today or tomorrow



General notes:
- Linux
- Public github
- Backend should be kept really lightweight (ngrok)

For next week:
Alex: json schemas/APIs
Eli: data schema and back end
Kelvin: UI and front end
